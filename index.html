    <h2>How to Make a Sandwich</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>First, get whatever bread you prefer or that's available</li>
        <li>Second, make sure the bread has either sliced into 2 peices or has 2 peices to use</li>
        <li>Third, use some kind of protien (Peanut butter or Deli meats work best) and layer the amount desired on one slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Fourth, if you used PB; take the second slice of bread and layer any jam,jelly, or honey to desired amount. For Deli meat, use any preferred type of cheese with desired amount to second bread slice</li>
        <li>Fifth, if you went with PB and jelly, combine both layered sides of bread against another and enjoy! For Deli meats, now you can either add lettuce or any leafy greens and or desired condiments to either bread slice. Combine both layered sides
            against another and enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
